# TeleQuest
The main idea of our project is to make an educative game app, which is gonna help theplayers to learn more about James Webb Space Telescope, and also to have fun while playing, and to challenge other players to answer Quick questions about the telescope. The game is gonna be a quiz game, but not any quiz game, it's gonna be a quiz game with many play modes, and many features, such as:

Solo mode: where the player will play:
alone, and answer questions about the telescope, in short time, and get points, to rank up. 2
with a friend, and answer Quick questions about the telescope, by the principle of "first click, first answer".
Online mode: where the player will challenge another one 1v1 to answer a quick
questions about the telescope, by the principle of "first click, first answer". and the winner will get points, and rank up.
